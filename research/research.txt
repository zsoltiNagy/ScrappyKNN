-> I will use WPF, it has the right tools in its toolkit for the basic version of the app.
-> I found a simple algorithm for calculating euclidian distance in C#, very basic example for calculating the distance between to points, 
should be extended:

int x0 = 1;
int y0 = 1;

int x1 = 100;
int y1 = 100;

int dX = x1 - x0;
int dY = y1 - y0;

double distance = Math.Sqrt(dX * dX + dY * dY);

-> I will read the previously found and downloaded dataset, for reading it I will implement a method using the StreamReader class
-> I will use a previously implemented python KNN (ScrappyKNN)
